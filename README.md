Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. 

This data set is for previous day earthquake.

Import & Visualize the Data

Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.


Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
